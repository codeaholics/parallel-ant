These libraries are here for Eclipse, because we are emulating the Maven
'provided' scope in gradle.build, but the Eclipse STS Gradle plugin
doesn't correctly pull the Ant JAR from the emulated 'provided' scope.
This results in compile errors in Eclipse because none of the Ant
classes are present. So we manually add the JARs from this directory to
the Eclipse classpath. Yuck.
