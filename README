This is alpha quality software.

There are a number of known issues and missing functionality. Please see

   http://code.google.com/p/parallel-ant/issues/list
   
for more details and to raise issues/requests.

Note in particular, the some of the error handling is not yet complete, and the
number of threads is currently fixed at 2 and not configurable (despite the
'pant' shell script giving that appearance!)

See the included 'pant' shell script for details of how to run Parallel Ant.
